 Above expression is clearly revealing that, the plot of a periodic perfect square wave requires infinite number of harmonics. These harmonics are the integer multiple of fundamental harmonics ω_0 (ω_0=2π/T, where T is the fundamental time period of the wave). The term a_0,a_n,b_n can be expressed as
